# 🎯 Goal:  
Understand what Cmdlets are and how they work in PowerShell.  

## 🧠 1. Important  

### What's this about?  
Cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets") are lightweight, built-in commands designed for specific tasks in PowerShell.  

### Key Features  
- **Verb-Noun format:** Commands follow this pattern (e.g., `Get-Process`).  
- **Built-in help:** Use `Get-Help` to learn how any cmdlet works.  
- **Consistent behavior:** Cmdlets handle objects and integrate with pipelines.  

### Extra Details  
- **Common verbs:** Get, Set, New, Remove, Start, Stop.  
- **Aliases:** Shortcuts for common cmdlets (e.g., `ls` is an alias for `Get-ChildItem`).  

## 🔍 2. My Own Words  
Cmdlets are like mini-tools that follow a "verb-noun" pattern — they do specific jobs like fetching, changing, or stopping things on your system.  

## 🔥 3. Analogy  
Cmdlets are like LEGO blocks — small, reusable, and can snap together to build bigger, more useful commands.  

## ✅ 4. One-Sentence Summary  
Cmdlets are the core commands of PowerShell, designed to handle specific tasks in a consistent, easy-to-use format.
