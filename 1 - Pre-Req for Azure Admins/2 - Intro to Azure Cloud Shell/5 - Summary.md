# Summary
Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-accessible command-line experience for managing Azure resources. Rather than having to configure an Azure CLI or PowerShell session from your workstation, you can access Cloud Shell on any standard, compliant browser.
Cloud Shell provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work, allowing you to work either in Bash or PowerShell, right from the browser. Cloud Shell also provides you with the mechanisms to persist files between sessions, and provides access to a minimalist version of the Visual Studio Code editor for more complex operations.
