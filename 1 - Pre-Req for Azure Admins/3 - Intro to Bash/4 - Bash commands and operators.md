# üéØ Goal:
Learn about commonly used Bash commands and how to use them to manage files, directories, and processes.

## üß† 1. Important

### What's this about?
This section focuses on essential Bash commands that help in navigating the file system, managing files and directories, and handling processes. Understanding these commands is crucial for working effectively with the terminal.

###  Key Features
Navigation Commands:
 - pwd: Prints the current working directory.
 - ls: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
 - cd: Changes the current directory.

File Manipulation Commands:
 - cp: Copies files or directories.
 - mv: Moves or renames files or directories.
 - rm: Removes files or directories.
 - touch: Creates a new empty file or updates an existing file‚Äôs timestamp.

Viewing Files:
 - cat: Displays the content of a file.
 - less: Views a file‚Äôs content one page at a time, useful for large files.
 - head: Views the first few lines of a file.
 - tail: Views the last few lines of a file.

Process Management:
 - ps: Displays information about active processes.
 - top: Provides an interactive, real-time view of the system‚Äôs processes.
 - kill: Sends a signal to terminate a process.

### Extra Details
 - File Permissions: Use chmod to modify the permissions of a file or directory.
 - Redirection: Use > to redirect output to a file and >> to append output to a file.
 - Pipes: Use | to send the output of one command into another.
 - Background Processes: Use & to run commands in the background. For example, command &.

## üîç 2. My Own Words
Bash provides simple commands to navigate the file system, manage files, and control processes. For example, pwd tells you where you are, ls shows you what's in the folder, and cd lets you move around. You can use cp and mv to copy and move files, and rm to delete them. To manage processes, you can use ps and top, and stop processes with kill. You can even redirect output and pipe commands together for more advanced functionality.

## üî• 3. Analogy
Imagine you‚Äôre in a library (your system), and Bash commands are like instructions to find, manage, and edit books (files). pwd tells you which shelf you're on, ls shows you all the books available, and cd lets you move to another shelf. Commands like cp and mv help you rearrange the books, and rm helps you throw out the ones you don‚Äôt need. If you're managing books (processes), ps and top let you see what‚Äôs currently being read, and kill is like closing a book when you‚Äôre done.

## ‚úÖ 4. One-Sentence Summary
Bash commands allow you to navigate your system, manage files, and control processes using simple instructions like ls, cd, cp, mv, and ps, with added functionality for background processes and piping.
