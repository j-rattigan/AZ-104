# üéØ Goal:
Learn the basic fundamentals of Bash commands and how to use them effectively.

## üß† 1. Important

### What's this about?
This section covers the essential Bash commands you need to interact with a system using the command line. It explains the structure of Bash commands, how to run them, and how to use options and arguments.

### Key Features
Basic Command Structure:
 - A Bash command generally follows the format: command [options] [arguments].

Common Commands:
 - pwd: Prints the current working directory.
 - ls: Lists files in the current directory.
 - cd: Changes the directory.
 - echo: Displays text or output to the screen.
 
Options and Arguments: Many commands come with options (e.g., -l for listing files in long format with ls), and arguments (e.g., a file or folder name).
Case Sensitivity: Bash commands are case-sensitive, so LS and ls are different commands.

### Extra Details
 - Wildcards: You can use wildcards (*, ?, []) to match file patterns.
 - Redirection: Use > to redirect output to a file and >> to append output to a file.
 - Pipes: Use | to pass the output of one command as input to another command. For example, ls | sort will list files and sort them alphabetically.

## üîç 2.My Own Words
Bash commands are simple instructions you type into the terminal to perform actions. For example, you use pwd to find your current folder, ls to see files, and cd to move between folders. You can add extra instructions (options and arguments) to make the commands more powerful, and you can even link commands together with pipes to make them work together.

## üî• 3. Analogy
Think of Bash as a set of tools in a toolbox. Each command is like a specific tool (e.g., a hammer for pwd or a wrench for ls). You can combine these tools in creative ways‚Äîjust like connecting multiple tools together‚Äîto complete a task more efficiently.

## ‚úÖ 4. One-Sentence Summary
Bash commands are used to interact with your system, where you can use simple instructions, options, and arguments to manage files and perform tasks, while advanced features like wildcards, redirection, and pipes give you more control.
