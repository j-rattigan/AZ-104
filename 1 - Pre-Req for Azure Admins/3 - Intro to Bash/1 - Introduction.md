# 🎯 Goal:
Learn the basics of Bash and its use in the Azure environment.

## 🧠 1. Important

### What's this about?
This section introduces Bash (Bourne Again Shell), a powerful command-line interface used in Unix-based operating systems. It’s important for interacting with the system and performing various tasks like automation, file management, and scripting.

### Key Features
 - Command-line interface: Bash allows you to interact with your system by typing commands instead of using a graphical interface.
 - Shell scripting: You can write scripts in Bash to automate repetitive tasks, which saves time and effort.
 - Environment Control: Bash provides a way to control the environment in which your commands are executed, such as defining variables and running scripts.
 - Job Control: Allows managing tasks or processes running in the background or foreground.
 - Portability: Scripts written in Bash can be run on any Unix-based operating system (like Linux and macOS), making it a versatile skill.

### Extra Details
 - Bash is widely used in cloud environments, particularly for automating tasks and managing infrastructure, which is why it’s important for working with Azure and other cloud platforms.
 - It integrates well with Azure Cloud Shell, allowing you to interact with resources, run automation scripts, and manage your environment more effectively.

## 🔍 2. My Own Words
Bash is a command-line tool used to interact with and control your computer or server. It’s perfect for running commands, automating processes, and managing files.
