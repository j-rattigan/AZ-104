### What are Azure Preview Features?
Azure Preview Features let you try out new, unreleased services and tools before they officially launch. These can include:
- New storage types
- New Azure services (e.g., Machine Learning improvements)
- Enhanced integrations with other platforms
- New APIs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:
- Each preview has specific terms and conditions.
- Some previews might not be covered by Azure support.
- Once a feature is fully tested, it moves to General Availability (GA) ‚Äî meaning it's now part of the standard Azure product set.

2 - It lists all active previews available for evaluation.
3 - Click a feature to learn more and enable it.

## üîç 2. My Own Words
Azure Preview Features are like sneak peeks at new Azure tools and services. They‚Äôre still being tested, so you might run into bugs or limits ‚Äî but you can give feedback to help improve them before they‚Äôre officially released.

## üî• 3. Analogy
Think of Azure Preview Features like a video game beta test. You get early access to new levels, characters, or mechanics ‚Äî but things might break, and you can give feedback to help developers fix it before the final release.

## ‚úÖ 4. One-Sentence Summary
Azure Preview Features let you explore and test upcoming Azure services, providing feedback before they‚Äôre finalized and released to the public.
