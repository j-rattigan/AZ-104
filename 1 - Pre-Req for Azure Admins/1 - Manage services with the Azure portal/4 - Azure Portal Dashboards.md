# 🎯 Goal:
Learn how to create, edit, manage, and share Azure portal dashboards for personalized resource monitoring.

## 🧠 1. Important

### What's this about?
Azure dashboards are customizable collections of UI tiles in the portal. You can create, modify, and share dashboards to monitor resources, track services, or organize tools for specific roles or projects.

### Key Features
- Default Dashboard: Named "Dashboard" and contains five default tiles. Accessible from the portal menu.
- Dashboard Controls: Located at the top — Create, Upload, Edit, Export, Share, Clone, Full Screen, and Delete.
- Dashboard Selector: Dropdown at the top-left to switch between different dashboards.
- Private vs Shared: Dashboards are private by default. Sharing requires assigning a resource group for storage.
- JSON Format: Dashboards are saved as JSON files — export, edit directly, and upload again for reuse.

### Editing Dashboards
- Create a New Dashboard: Select "Create," choose "Custom" for a blank layout, add tiles, and save.
- Add Tiles: Use the Tile Gallery (right-side panel), drag and drop tiles into the work area. Pin elements directly from resource pages using the Pin icon.
- Resize Tiles: Drag the gray corner of resizable tiles or right-click for size options.
- Tile Settings: Some tiles, like clocks, have editable settings (e.g., time zones).
- Preview and Save: Use "Preview" to check the layout before saving.

### Managing Dashboards
- Export/Import Dashboards: Download as JSON for editing or sharing.
- Clone Dashboards: Makes a copy ("Clone of <dashboard name>") and opens it in edit mode — great for quick variations.
- Share Dashboards: Select "Share," assign a resource group, and control access with permissions.
- Unshare Dashboards: Go to "Manage Sharing" to stop sharing or adjust permissions.
- Delete Dashboards: Removes the dashboard permanently — no recovery!

## 🔍 2. My Own Words
Azure dashboards are customizable workspaces where you can mix and match UI tiles to track what matters most. You can create your own layouts, edit tiles, export them as JSON files, and even share them with your team. It’s like building a control center for your Azure services.

## 🔥 3. Analogy
Think of an Azure dashboard like a custom tool board in a workshop. You can arrange the tools (tiles) you use most in the perfect order, resize or replace them when needed, and even share your setup with the rest of the team — or clone it for a second workspace with slight tweaks.

## ✅ 4. One-Sentence Summary
Azure dashboards are personalized, tile-based workspaces that let you monitor, manage, and share resource data, all stored as JSON files for easy customization and portability.
